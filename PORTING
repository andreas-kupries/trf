Porting notes for Tcl-Trf, the transformers package
---------------------------------------------------

DEC/OSF1 V3.2
	generic/idea.c must not be compiled with -O, -O2, -O3, ...
	-O1 is allowed.

	Reason: With optimization set to high the procedure
	'MulInv' (residing in included file 'generic/idea/idea.c')
	will generate erroneous results for a number of arguments
	(example: MulInv (17)=0 instead of 30841).
	In the end decryption goes wrong.
