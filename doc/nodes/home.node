	[trf] is an extension library to the script language [tcl], as created
	by [jo]. It extends the language at the C-level with so-called
	``transformer''-procedures. With the help of some patches to the core
	the package is able to intercept all read/write operations on
	designated channels, thus giving it the ability to transform the
	buffer contents as desired. This allows things like transparent
	encryption, compression, charset recoding, etc.
	Build upon this framework (and as proof of concept) a collection of
	[tcl]-level commands was implemented, most of them related to
	cryptography. Additionally some binary data support is put in as well.
