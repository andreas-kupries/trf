extension trf {
    description {
	A loadable extension to Tcl providing commands for data conversion,
	message digests, zlib based compression, error-correction,
	channel-based manipulation of binary data.

	Trf extends the language at the C-level with so-called
	``transformer''-procedures. With the help of some patches to the
	core the package is able to intercept all read/write operations
	on designated channels, thus giving it the ability to transform
	the buffer contents as desired. This allows things like
	transparent encryption, compression, charset recoding,
	etc. Build upon this framework (and as proof of concept) a
	collection of tcl-level commands was implemented. Additionally
	some binary data support is put in as well.

	A separate package containing encryption transformation is available
	at the same site carrying this package.
