		Tcl Data transformations (Tcl-Trf)
		(Version @VERSION@ / @DATE@)

		Andreas Kupries	(a.kupries@westend.com)

This directory contains a freely distributable extension to Tcl/Tk called Tcl
Data transformations (Tcl-Trf). The collection of provided transformation
procedures includes:

*	Data encryption:

	IDEA, Blowfish, RC4
	DES		(if 'libdes' is available as shared library)

*	Generation of message digests (hash values, checksums)

	MD5, SHA/SHS, HAVAL
	CRC (polynomial used by PGP)
	ADLER (based upon zlib)

*	Conversion from and to various data encodings:

	dual, octal, hexadecimal representation	
	uuencoding, base64-encoding, ascii85-encoding

*	A reed-solomon error correcting coder.
*	(De)Compression based on zlib 1.0.4	(if available as shared library)

Example applications distributed with the package are:

*	'tools/md', a message digest generator. Upwardly compatible to 'md5sum'.

Tcl-Trf is developed for Tcl 7.6 or higher.  It is a pure Tcl extension, Tk is
not required.  The extension requires a patched core. Patch files for 7.6 and
8.0a1 are part of the distribution.  The plus-patches maintained by Jan
Nijtmans (nijtmans@nici.kun.nl) contain this patch too .  Supporting (optional)
packages are:

*	memchan 1.0 or higher
*	zlib-1.0.4  or higher
*	libdes 3.21 or higher


This distribution contains the source code for Tcl-Trf + documentation
describing commands (-> latex) and c-level interfaces (-> man-pages).

Primary ftp-site is

And for convencience:

        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/zlib-1.0.4.tar.gz>
        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/libdes-3.23.tar.gz>

There will be NO upload to the official ftp-archive at ftp.neosoft.com
to avoid problems with US export regulations (ITAR, cryptography
is ammunition).
