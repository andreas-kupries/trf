Hello world,

well, after Jan Nijtmans pre-announcement, here comes
the 2nd beta release of Tcl-Trf, the transformer package enabling
you to do

*	encryption
*	data compression,
*	computation of message digests
*	error correcting coding
*	and data conversion (bin, hex, base64, ...)

Changes from b1 to b2:

*	The patches to the core are enhanced to associate channels
	with byteorder information.

*	A new command 'binio' to pack and/or unpack binary information and
	to copy between channels (the latter is essentially 'unsupported0').
	(Un)packing will reorder bytes as needed, using the information
	mentioned above.

The package compiles cleanly with tcl 8.0a1/2.

It can be found at
        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/trf1.0b2.tar.gz>
        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/trf1.0b2.readme>

For convenience some supporting libraries are provided as well:

        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/zlib-1.0.4.tar.gz>
        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/libdes-3.23.tar.gz>
        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/memchan1.1.tar.gz>

        The package does contain the README-files of zlib and libdes, these
        then contain pointers to the locations of the associated packages.

IMPORTANT:
*       Due to US-legalese (ITAR, export restrictions placed on crypto-
        software) I refrained from loading this package to the primary
        archive at Neosoft.

PLATFORMS:
	tested:
		Linux 1.2.13	(gcc 2.7.0)	Development sytem
		IRIX 6.2	(cc only)
		ULTRIX 4.1	(both cc and gcc)
		ULTRIX 4.4	(cc 3.0)
		HP-UX-9		(both cc and gcc)
		HP-UX-10.2
		Solaris 2.5	(gcc only)

	Other machines and OS's should work too. 

Feedback about other OS's and compilers is appreciated. Please
help me in making this package better.

Enjoy,
