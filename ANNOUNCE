Hello world,

Hereby I announce the transformer package Tcl-Trf @mFullVersion@
enabling you to do

*	encryption
*	data compression,
*	computation of message digests
*	error correcting coding
*	and data conversion (bin, hex, base64, ...)

Abstract:
	Trf extends the language at the C-level with so-called
	``transformer''-procedures. With the help of some patches to the
	core the package is able to intercept all read/write operations
	on designated channels, thus giving it the ability to transform
	the buffer contents as desired. This allows things like
	transparent encryption, compression, charset recoding,
	etc. Build upon this framework (and as proof of concept) a
	collection of tcl-level commands was implemented, most of them
	related to cryptography. Additionally some binary data support
	is put in as well.

Changes from b3 to final:

*	Added general transformation 'transform'. Reflects the underlying
	functionality up into the script level.

Changes from b2 to b3:

*	'binio' command supported, but not included by default, because
	of equivalent functionality in 8.0b1, see 'binary' and 'fcopy'.
	Configure option '--enable-binio'.

*	Reorganized code into generic and os dependent parts.

*	Added Windows port.

*	Some bug fixes.

*	More algorithms: RC2, MD2, SHA-1	(SSLeay required)
			 RIPEMD-160

*	Commands created use the object-interface of tcl8.0b1 now.
	Runs with 7.6 nevertheless, BUT NOT with 8.0a1 or a2.


Changes from b1 to b2:

*	The patches to the core are enhanced to associate channels
	with byteorder information.

*	A new command 'binio' to pack and/or unpack binary information and
	to copy between channels (the latter is essentially 'unsupported0').
	(Un)packing will reorder bytes as needed, using the information
	mentioned above.


The package compiles cleanly with tcl 7.6, 8.0b1 (not a1, a2!).


It can be found at
        <ftp://ftp.westend.com/pub/aku/trf@mFullVersion@.tar.gz>
        <ftp://ftp.westend.com/pub/aku/trf@mDosVersion@.zip>
        <ftp://ftp.westend.com/pub/aku/trf@mFullVersion@.readme>

        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/trf@mFullVersion@.readme>

For convenience some supporting libraries are provided as well:

        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/memchan1.2.tar.gz>
or      <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/memchan12.zip>
        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/zlib-1.0.4.tar.gz>
        <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/ext/libdes-3.23.tar.gz>

        The package does contain the README-files of zlib and libdes, these
        then contain pointers to the locations of the associated packages.

IMPORTANT:
*       Due to US-legalese (ITAR, export restrictions placed on crypto-
        software) I refrained from loading this package to the primary
        archive at Neosoft.

PLATFORMS:
	tested:
		Linux 2.0.29	(gcc 2.7.2.1)	Development system (yes, I made an upgrade)
		IRIX 6.2	(cc only)
		ULTRIX 4.1	(both cc and gcc)
		ULTRIX 4.4	(cc 3.0)
		HP-UX-9		(both cc and gcc)
		HP-UX-10.2
		Solaris 2.5	(gcc only)

	Other machines and OS's should work too. 

Feedback about other OS's and compilers is appreciated. Please
help me in making this package better.

Enjoy,
